<!--Arrays are dynamic and can hold any kind of data of any data type at the same time -->
<!-- i.e. You can have a string, integer or floating values, all in a single array-->
<!-- In JavaScript, the size of array is dynamic and can even be changed at run time -->
<!-- In short the functioning if Arrays is more like Lists in Python-->
